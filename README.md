# Wuhu Point Two
## Chili Onions - By Orion Hess and Cash Hilstad

<br>

## What?
We made a recreation of Wii Sports Resort's Island Flyover in Godot. You get to fly around a classic Wuhu Island, viewing the golf fairways, the massive volcano, and other features of the island

## Why? 
Cause its an awesome blast of nostalgia

## How?
Godot is awesome!
We found blender files for the Wuhu Island assets, imported them into Godot, and got to work on fixing them. 
They did not love being imported into Godot, and definitely were a hasle, but we pushed through and got to work on a plane controller to fly around in. 
That again took some time, but we are relatively happy with the finished product!
